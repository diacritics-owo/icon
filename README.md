# Icon

A simple mod that allows the Minecraft icon to be changed via resource packs

*For modpack makers*: you may use this mod in your modpack with or without credit

## Using

This mod supports only Windows, macOS, and X11 desktops.

Download a resource pack that provides icons, and enable it. Once the resources finish reloading, you should see that the icon in the dock/taskbar has changed.

This mod comes with a default resource pack called Alternate Icons. It's disabled by default, but you can enable it in the resource pack screen.
